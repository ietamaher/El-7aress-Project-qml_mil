- Lens cleaning pen (optional)

**Procedure:**

```
☐ System powered OFF
☐ Inspect lens for contamination
   ☐ Dust, dirt, fingerprints, water spots

☐ Dust Removal (if dusty)
   ☐ Use compressed air to blow off loose dust
   ☐ Hold can upright (not inverted)
   ☐ Short bursts, 6 inches from lens
   ☐ OR use soft brush to gently sweep dust away

☐ Cleaning (if smudged or spotted)
   ☐ Apply 1-2 drops of lens solution to microfiber cloth
   ☐ Never apply directly to lens
   ☐ Gently wipe in circular motion from center outward
   ☐ Use dry section of cloth to remove moisture
   ☐ Inspect for streaks, re-clean if needed

☐ Final Inspection
   ☐ Power on system
   ☐ View camera image
   ☐ Verify image clear, no smudges
   ☐ If spots remain: repeat cleaning
```

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Use paper towels (scratches lens)
- ❌ Use household cleaners (damages coatings)
- ❌ Breathe on lens and wipe (saliva is corrosive)
- ❌ Rub hard (damages anti-reflective coating)
- ❌ Clean in direct sunlight (solution dries too fast)

### 14.3.2 External Cleaning

**Gimbal Housing and Surfaces:**

```
☐ Power OFF
☐ Use soft cloth dampened with water
☐ Wipe external surfaces
☐ Remove dirt, salt spray, grease
☐ Dry with clean cloth
☐ Do NOT spray water directly into openings
```

**Cable and Connector Cleaning:**

```
☐ Power OFF, cables disconnected (if possible)
☐ Wipe cables with damp cloth
☐ Inspect connectors for corrosion
☐ If corrosion visible: Notify maintenance (do not clean)
☐ If dirt in connector: Use compressed air only
☐ Do NOT use liquid cleaners on connectors
```

### 14.3.3 Protective Covers

**When to Use:**
