## 15.6 COMMON ERRORS AND CORRECTIONS

### 15.6.1 Frequent Student Errors

**Error: Rushing Through Checklists**
- Symptom: Skipping steps, incomplete inspection
- Correction: Instructor stops student, restart from beginning
- Teaching Point: Speed comes with practice, accuracy is priority

**Error: Forgetting Safety Interlocks**
- Symptom: Trying to enable LAC without Dead Man Switch
- Correction: Point out blocked operation, explain why
- Teaching Point: Safety interlocks prevent accidents

**Error: Fighting the Tracker**
- Symptom: Large joystick inputs while tracking active
- Correction: Demonstrate smooth assist vs. fighting
- Teaching Point: Let tracker do work, provide gentle corrections only

**Error: Manual Leading with LAC Active**
- Symptom: Aiming ahead of target when LAC already applied
- Correction: Explain pipper already shows lead
- Teaching Point: Aim pipper at target, not ahead

**Error: Not Verifying Settings**
- Symptom: Engaging without checking zero, windage status
- Correction: Have student check OSD indicators
- Teaching Point: Always verify ballistics before engagement

### 15.6.2 Coaching Techniques

**Positive Reinforcement:**
- "Good smooth joystick control on that acquisition"
- "Excellent prioritization of targets"
- "Perfect tracking abort, very fast response"

**Corrective Feedback:**
- "Stop - you skipped the range step, let's back up"
- "Notice the pipper is showing lead already, don't aim ahead"
- "Check your System Status - what does it tell you?"

**Guided Discovery:**
- "What indicator tells you LAC is active?"
- "Why did the system block that operation?"
- "What should you check first when tracking won't lock?"
