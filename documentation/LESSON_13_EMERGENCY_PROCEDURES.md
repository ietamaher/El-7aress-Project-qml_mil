## 13.1 EMERGENCY STOP (E-STOP)

### 13.1.1 E-Stop Button Location

**Physical Location:** Red mushroom button on Control Panel (PLC21)

**Function:** Immediately disables all weapon system motion and power

**When to Use:**
- ❌ Personnel in line of fire
- ❌ Gimbal moving toward restricted area
- ❌ Runaway/uncontrolled motion
- ❌ Any immediate danger requiring instant stop

### 13.1.2 E-Stop Activation Procedure

**Immediate Action:**
```
☐ Strike E-STOP button (large red mushroom)
☐ Button latches in pressed position
☐ System immediately stops all motion
☐ Weapon systems disabled
☐ "EMERGENCY STOP ACTIVE" alarm appears
```

**System Effects:**
- All gimbal motion halted instantly
- Weapon fire control disabled
- Tracking stopped
- Most system functions locked out

### 13.1.3 E-Stop Reset Procedure

**Only reset after verifying:**
```
☐ Immediate danger cleared
☐ Personnel clear of weapon system
☐ No equipment damage observed
☐ Cause of emergency identified
☐ Safe to resume operations
```

**Reset Procedure:**
```
☐ Twist E-STOP button clockwise
☐ Button pops out (unlatched)
☐ System begins reset sequence
☐ "EMERGENCY STOP ACTIVE" alarm clears
☐ Check System Status for any faults
☐ Perform system health check before resuming
```

**DO NOT reset E-Stop if:**
- Cause of emergency not identified
- Equipment damage visible
- Personnel still in danger zone
- Maintenance required

---

## 13.2 EMERGENCY TRACKING ABORT

### 13.2.1 Tracking Abort Situations

**Abort tracking immediately when:**
- ❌ Tracking wrong target (misidentification)
- ❌ Target enters restricted zone (No-Fire/No-Traverse)
- ❌ Friendly forces near target
- ❌ Lost positive identification
- ❌ System behaving erratically
- ❌ Civilian/non-combatant identified

### 13.2.2 Emergency Abort Procedure

**Double-Click Method (Primary):**
```
☐ Double-click Button 4 (Track Select) rapidly (<500ms)
☐ Tracking stops immediately
☐ Tracking gate disappears
☐ Gimbal motion stops
☐ Returns to Manual mode
```

**No Safety Interlocks Required:**
- Dead Man Switch NOT required for abort
- Works from any tracking phase
- Immediate response

**Alternative Methods (If Joystick Failed):**
```
Option 1: E-STOP button (stops everything)
Option 2: Turn Station power OFF on Control Panel
Option 3: Exit tracking via menu system (slower)
```

### 13.2.3 Post-Abort Actions

```
☐ Assess why abort was necessary
☐ Slew gimbal away from target area
☐ Verify correct target identification procedures
☐ Report incident to chain of command
☐ Document in operations log
```

2. Release Button 0 (Master Arm) - disarm weapon
3. Point gimbal to safe direction (typically skyward)
4. Engage E-STOP if motion continues
5. Turn Station power OFF
```

**Follow-Up Actions:**
```
☐ Safe weapon (clear ammunition if possible)

```

### 13.3.2 Weapon Runaway (Continuous Fire)

**Symptoms:** Weapon continues firing after releasing trigger

**Immediate Actions:**
```
1. Release all buttons immediately
2. E-STOP - strike emergency stop
3. Station power OFF
4. Verify fire has ceased
5. Alert all personnel - "RUNAWAY GUN"
```

**DO NOT:**
- Attempt to stop weapon mechanically
- Approach weapon until verified safe
- Re-power system

**Follow-Up:**
```
☐ Evacuate immediate area
☐ Wait for ammunition exhaustion (if runaway continues)
☐ Notify armorer immediately - CRITICAL
☐ Tag system as inoperative
☐ Require armorer inspection before any operation
```

### 13.3.3 Weapon Malfunction (Jam, Misfire)

**Immediate Actions:**
```
☐ Release fire button (Button 5)
☐ Release Master Arm (Button 0)
☐ Keep gimbal pointed at target (do NOT slew away)
☐ Announce "STOPPAGE" or "MISFIRE"
☐ Wait 30 seconds (misfire safety delay)
```

**Clearance Procedure:**
```
☐ After 30-second delay
☐ Visually inspect weapon (if accessible)
☐ Follow unit weapon clearing procedures
☐ If cannot clear: Tag as inoperative

## 13.4 GIMBAL RUNAWAY / UNCONTROLLED MOTION

### 13.4.1 Symptoms

**Indicators of Runaway Gimbal:**
- Gimbal moving rapidly without joystick input
- Motion does not respond to joystick commands
- Gimbal approaching mechanical limits at high speed
- Gimbal oscillating or spinning uncontrollably

### 13.4.2 Emergency Response

**Immediate Actions:**
```
1. E-STOP - strike emergency stop button immediately
2. Station power OFF (if E-Stop ineffective)
3. Step back from system (mechanical hazard)
4. Announce "RUNAWAY GIMBAL"
```

**DO NOT:**

**Immediate Actions:**
```
☐ Attempt button presses (verify truly lost)
☐ Check physical cable connection to Control Panel
☐ If still lost: System is degraded
☐ Joystick functions may still work
☐ E-STOP should still function (hardwired)
```

**Operational Constraints:**
- ✓ Can still use joystick for gimbal control
- ✓ Can still use joystick buttons (fire, track, etc.)
- ✗ Cannot access menus
- ✗ Cannot use Control Panel switches (LRF, camera, etc.)
- ✗ Cannot view settings or system status via menu

**Recovery:**
```
☐ Power cycle system (if tactically feasible)
☐ Check cable connections
☐ If persistent: Notify maintenance, continue with joystick only
```

### 13.5.2 Lost Camera Video Feed

**Symptoms:**
- Display shows black screen or frozen image
- System Status shows camera disconnected or error

**Immediate Actions:**
```
☐ Switch to alternate camera (day ↔ thermal)
☐ If both cameras lost: Cannot engage targets safely
☐ Safe weapon immediately
☐ Point gimbal to safe direction
☐ Notify command - mission capability lost
```

**Troubleshooting:**
```
☐ Power cycle cameras (Control Panel switch)
☐ Check System Status for camera errors
☐ If one camera works: Continue with that camera
☐ If both lost: System inoperable for engagement
```

### 13.5.3 Lost Servo Communication

**Symptoms:**
- Gimbal frozen, unresponsive to joystick
- System Status shows servo disconnected
- Alarm: "Az/El Servo Disconnected"

**Immediate Actions:**
```
☐ Release all joystick inputs
☐ Do NOT force joystick (no effect, may damage)
☐ Station power OFF (prevent erratic behavior if reconnects)
☐ Notify maintenance immediately
☐ System inoperable until servo communication restored
```

**Safety Considerations:**
- Gimbal position frozen at last location
- Verify not pointed at restricted area or personnel
- If pointed at hazard: Physically secure gimbal if possible

☐ Disable LAC (Hold Button 3 + Press Button 2)
☐ Stop tracking (Double-click Button 4)
☐ Return to Manual mode (Button 11/13)
☐ Use basic reticle (not CCIP) if available via menu
```

**Workaround:**

## 13.12 DECISION-MAKING UNDER STRESS

### 13.12.1 Emergency Priority Matrix

**Priority Order:**

1. **PERSONNEL SAFETY** (Highest Priority)
   - Stop all motion if personnel at risk
   - E-STOP if doubt

2. **WEAPON SAFETY**
   - Safe weapon immediately if malfunction
   - Disarm if any uncertainty

3. **EQUIPMENT PROTECTION**
   - Controlled shutdown preferred over forced
   - E-STOP if uncontrolled motion

4. **MISSION CONTINUATION**
   - Only after safety ensured
   - Workarounds if systems degraded

### 13.12.2 Emergency Decision Flowchart

```
Emergency Occurs
    ↓
Is there immediate danger to personnel?
    YES → E-STOP, evacuate, report
    NO ↓
Is weapon involved?
    YES → Safe weapon, Master Arm OFF, assess
    NO ↓
Is system controllable?
    YES → Controlled shutdown, notify maintenance
    NO → E-STOP, power OFF, notify maintenance
    ↓
Document and report all emergencies
```

## 13.13 LESSON SUMMARY

### Key Points

1. **E-Stop button:** Immediately stops all motion, use for any immediate danger

2. **Tracking abort:** Double-click Button 4, no interlocks, instant stop

3. **Weapon runaway:** Release buttons → E-STOP → Power OFF → Notify armorer

4. **Gimbal runaway:** E-STOP immediately, do NOT attempt physical block

5. **Lost communications:** PLC21 loss = limited capability, servo loss = inoperable

6. **Emergency shutdown:** Controlled (via menu) or forced (E-STOP + power OFF)

7. **Emergency calls:** "CEASE FIRE", "RUNAWAY GUN", "E-STOP", etc.

8. **Priority:** Personnel safety → Weapon safety → Equipment → Mission

9. **Post-emergency:** Document, notify, inspect, get clearance before restart

10. **Drills:** Practice emergency responses until reflexive (<1 second response)

### Critical Actions to Memorize

**E-Stop Location:** Red mushroom button on Control Panel
**Tracking Abort:** Double-click Button 4 (<500ms)
**Weapon Safe:** Release Button 5, Release Button 0, point safe direction
**Emergency Shutdown:** E-STOP + Station Power OFF
**Priority:** PEOPLE → WEAPON → EQUIPMENT → MISSION
