## 18.1 LIVE FIRE SAFETY

### 18.1.1 Critical Safety Rules (Zero Tolerance)

**RULE 1: Treat Every Weapon as Loaded**
- Always assume weapon is live and ready to fire
- Never point weapon at anything you don't intend to destroy
- Verify clear only through proper clearing procedure

**RULE 2: Never Point Weapon at Personnel or Restricted Areas**
- Maintain constant awareness of gimbal aim direction
- Safe direction: Downrange into impact area only
- Emergency stop if weapon swings toward personnel

**RULE 3: Keep Weapon Safed Until Ready to Fire**
- Master Arm OFF except during engagement
- Station power OFF when not actively operating
- Physical safety on weapon (if equipped)

**RULE 4: Know Your Target and What's Beyond**
- Positive identification before firing
- Verify clear impact area (no personnel, vehicles downrange)
- Understand range boundaries and backstop

**RULE 5: Range Safety Officer Has Absolute Authority**
- Immediate compliance with all RSO commands
- "CEASE FIRE" = Stop firing instantly, Master Arm OFF
- "MAKE SAFE" = Weapon cleared, Station power OFF

### 18.1.2 Range Safety Personnel

**Range Safety Officer (RSO):** Primary safety authority, controls range
**Assistant Safety Officer:** Monitors specific firing points
**Medical Personnel:** On standby for emergencies
**Armorer:** Weapon system expert, handles malfunctions
**Instructor/Coach:** Supervises student, provides guidance

## 18.5 PHASE 1: STATIONARY TARGET ENGAGEMENT

### 18.5.1 Scenario 1: Initial Familiarization (30 rounds)

**Objectives:**
- Build confidence with live fire
- Confirm zero with live ammunition
- Understand recoil and weapon behavior

**Targets:**
- 3 stationary targets at 200m, 300m, 400m
- Large targets (2m × 2m minimum)

**Procedure:**
```
☐ RSO: "THE RANGE IS HOT, COMMENCE FIRING"
☐ Student: Load weapon (Armorer supervises)
☐ Select target (200m) - closest first
☐ Range with LRF
☐ Center CCIP pipper on target
☐ Master Arm ON (Button 0)
☐ Fire 3-round burst (Button 5)
☐ Observe tracers, impacts
☐ Assess: On target or need correction
☐ Master Arm OFF
☐ Instructor: Brief student on group placement
```

**Repeat for 300m and 400m targets**

**Instructor Coaching:**
- "Good steady aim, impacts on target"
- "Rounds hitting low - verify zero"
- "Hold pipper steady during firing"

**Common First-Time Shooter Issues:**
- Flinching (anticipating recoil)
- Pulling pipper off target during fire
- Not holding Master Arm long enough
- Jerky joystick movements from adrenaline

---

☐ Fire 5-round burst
☐ Observe tracer impacts (should hit moving target)
☐ Continue tracking
☐ Fire additional bursts as target crosses
☐ Master Arm OFF
☐ Disable LAC
☐ Stop tracking
```

**Expected Results:**
- Tracer impacts on moving target
- Burst grouping shows consistent lead
- 40-60% hit rate acceptable for first moving engagement

**If Misses:**

- Vehicle B: 8 m/s, right-to-left, 700m

**Procedure:**
```
☐ Both targets begin moving
☐ Engage Vehicle A first (faster, closer):
   ☐ Track, LAC, range, engage
   ☐ Fire 15 rounds
☐ Transition to Vehicle B:
   ☐ Abort tracking on A
   ☐ Acquire and track B
   ☐ LAC already enabled (stays on)
   ☐ Range, engage
   ☐ Fire 15 rounds

**Conditions:**
- Crosswind: 10 knots from 090° (East)
- Target: 800m, Az: 000° (North) - perpendicular to wind

**Procedure:**

**Part A: No Windage (Baseline)**
```
☐ Fire 5 rounds at target (no windage applied)
☐ Observe impacts (should be right of target - wind drift)
☐ Note offset distance
```

**Part B: With Windage**
```
☐ Apply windage (10 knots from 090°)
☐ Verify "W" indicator on OSD
☐ Fire 15 rounds at same target
☐ Observe impacts (should be on target - wind compensated)
☐ Compare to Part A (clear improvement)
```

**Instructor Discussion:**
- Windage correction effective for crosswind
- Combined with zero for complete accuracy

☐ Student identifies all 3 targets
☐ Student announces priority order: 1, 2 (skip 3)
☐ Engage Target 1 (moving, high threat):
   ☐ Track, LAC, engage (20 rounds)
☐ Shift to Target 2 (stationary):
   ☐ Range, engage (20 rounds)
☐ Do NOT engage Target 3 (non-threat)

**Evaluation:**
- Correct prioritization
- Did NOT engage non-threat target
- Effective engagement techniques used
