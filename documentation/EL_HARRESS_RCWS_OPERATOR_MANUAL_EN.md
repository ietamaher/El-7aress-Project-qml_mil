---

## 3.3 JOYSTICK CONTROL BASICS

### **Joystick Overview**

The operator joystick is the primary interface for aiming the weapon system and controlling engagement.

**Joystick Type**: Flight-style control stick (HOTAS design - Hands On Throttle And Stick)

**Primary Functions**:
- Gimbal aiming (azimuth and elevation)
- Weapon engagement (trigger)
- Camera controls (zoom, thermal palettes)
- Tracking controls
- Mode selection

---

### **3.3.1 Main Stick Axes**

**Two axes of motion**:

#### **X-Axis: Azimuth Control (Left/Right)**

**Function**: Controls gimbal azimuth (horizontal rotation)

**Operation**:
- Push stick LEFT → Gimbal rotates LEFT (counterclockwise)
- Push stick RIGHT → Gimbal rotates RIGHT (clockwise)
- Return stick to CENTER → Gimbal stops

**Control Type**: Velocity control (rate control)
- Small stick deflection = slow gimbal movement
- Large stick deflection = fast gimbal movement
- Stick centered = gimbal stopped

**Velocity Scaling**: Stick deflection × 10.0 degrees/second
- Stick at 50% deflection = 5°/second gimbal speed
- Stick at 100% deflection (full) = 10°/second gimbal speed

**Range**: -1.0 (full left) to +1.0 (full right), normalized

---

#### **Y-Axis: Elevation Control (Up/Down)**

**Function**: Controls gimbal elevation (vertical movement)

**Operation**:
- Push stick FORWARD (away from you) → Gimbal tilts DOWN
- Pull stick BACK (toward you) → Gimbal tilts UP
- Return stick to CENTER → Gimbal stops

**Control Type**: Velocity control (rate control)
- Small stick deflection = slow gimbal movement
- Large stick deflection = fast gimbal movement
- Stick centered = gimbal stopped

**Velocity Scaling**: Stick deflection × 10.0 degrees/second (inverted)
- Stick at 50% deflection = 5°/second gimbal speed
- Stick at 100% deflection (full) = 10°/second gimbal speed

**Range**: -1.0 (full forward) to +1.0 (full back), normalized

**Note**: Y-axis is inverted - pushing forward moves gimbal down. This is standard for flight-style controls.

---

### **3.3.2 Joystick Technique**

**Proper Grip**:
1. Grip joystick comfortably but firmly
2. Wrist relaxed
3. Forearm supported on armrest (if available)
4. Index finger on trigger
5. Thumb on hat switch (D-Pad)
6. Other fingers wrapped around grip

**Smooth Control**:
- Use small, smooth movements
- Avoid jerky or rapid stick movements
- Anticipate gimbal inertia (gimbal takes time to start/stop)
- Center stick gently to stop motion (don't release abruptly)

**Precision Aiming**:
- Use small stick deflections (10-30%) for precision
- Use larger deflections (50-100%) for rapid slewing
- Practice smooth transitions between fast slewing and precision aiming

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Gripping too tightly (causes fatigue and jerky control)
- ❌ Over-controlling (excessive stick movements)
- ❌ Not centering stick (gimbal continues moving)
- ❌ Releasing stick abruptly (causes oscillation)

---

### **3.3.3 Primary Buttons (Basic Operations)**

For this lesson, we focus on essential buttons. Advanced buttons covered in Lesson 8.

#### **Button 0: Master Arm**

**Location**: Trigger stage 1 (half-pull on trigger)

**Function**: Arms weapon system (alternative to Control Panel Master Arm switch)

**Operation**:
- Pull trigger halfway → Master Arm engaged, "ARMED" light ON
- Release → Master Arm disengaged, "ARMED" light OFF

**Usage**: Hold at stage 1 when ready to fire, then pull fully to stage 2 to fire weapon.

**Safety**: Do NOT engage Master Arm unless ready to fire immediately.

---

#### **Button 5: Fire Weapon**

**Location**: Trigger stage 2 (full-pull on trigger)

3. Observe gimbal moving right AND up simultaneously
4. Hold for 3 seconds
5. Center joystick
6. Observe gimbal stopping
7. Note final position (e.g., AZ: 10°, EL: 5°)
8. Practice all four diagonal directions:
   - Right/Up (push right and back)
   - Right/Down (push right and forward)
   - Left/Up (push left and back)
   - Left/Down (push left and forward)

**Success Criteria**:
- Smooth diagonal motion
- Coordinated movement in both axes
- Predictable direction control

---

### **Exercise 3.4.3: Target Centering**

**Objective**: Learn to place reticle on a target

**Setup**: Use a visible target or landmark (e.g., distant building, vehicle, terrain feature)

**Procedure**:

1. Identify target visually on screen (not centered)
2. Estimate direction to move gimbal (left/right, up/down)
3. Move joystick in appropriate direction
4. Observe target moving toward center of screen
5. As target approaches reticle, reduce stick deflection (slow down)
6. Make fine adjustments with small stick movements
7. Center reticle on target
8. Hold position for 3 seconds

**Success Criteria**:

3. Observe gimbal moving at maximum speed (~10°/second)
4. After 2 seconds, rapidly center joystick
5. Observe gimbal stopping
6. Note final position (e.g., AZ: 20°)
7. Practice rapid slews in all directions

**Success Criteria**:
- Gimbal reaches maximum speed
- Stops cleanly without oscillation
- No overshoot beyond intended position

**Common Issues**:
- If gimbal oscillates after stop: Released stick too abruptly - center more gently
- If gimbal overshoots: Anticipated stop too late - center earlier

---

### **3.4.5 Gimbal Movement Limits**

**Azimuth Limits**:
- **Range**: 360° continuous rotation (no limits)
- **Behavior**: Gimbal can rotate continuously in either direction
- **Display**: Azimuth wraps around (359° → 0° or 0° → 359°)

**Elevation Limits**:
- **Range**: -20° (down) to +60° (up)
- **Behavior**: Gimbal stops at limits (hard stops)
- **Effect**: If stick held beyond limit, gimbal stays at limit (cannot move further)

**No-Traverse Zone Limits** (if configured):
- Gimbal stops at zone boundary
- Warning displayed on screen
- Cannot move into restricted area

**Safety**: If gimbal stops unexpectedly, check for:
- Elevation limit reached
- No-traverse zone boundary
- Physical obstruction (emergency stop immediately if suspected)

## 3.5 CAMERA OPERATIONS

### **3.5.1 Camera Selection (Day/Thermal Toggle)**

**Two cameras available**:
1. **Day Camera**: Visible spectrum, color, high resolution, 20x optical zoom
2. **Thermal Camera**: Infrared, heat signatures, see through smoke, 2x digital zoom

**Toggle Method** (platform-specific - check your configuration):

**Option A: Control Panel Switch**
- Camera Select switch
- Toggle to "DAY" or "THERMAL" position

**Option B: Joystick Button**
- Press designated camera toggle button (varies by platform)

**Option C: Menu Selection**
- Not recommended during operations (too slow)

**Display Indication**:
- Bottom of screen shows: "Camera: DAY" or "Camera: THERMAL"
- Camera icon changes color/style

**When to Use Each Camera**:

| Camera | Best For | Limitations |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Day Camera** | Daylight operations, color identification, long-range (with zoom), precise aiming | Poor in low light, cannot see through smoke/dust |
| **Thermal Camera** | Night operations, low visibility, heat signature detection, camouflaged targets | Lower resolution, cannot see through glass, less precise |

**Typical Usage**:
- **Day**: Primary camera for daylight operations
- **Thermal**: Night operations and low visibility conditions
- **Toggle between**: Use thermal to detect targets, switch to day for identification (if light permits)

---

### **3.5.2 Zoom Controls**

**Purpose**: Magnify image for target identification or precision aiming

#### **Zoom In (Button 6)**

**Operation**:
1. Press and HOLD Button 6
2. Image zooms in (magnifies) continuously
3. Release when desired zoom level reached

**Effect**:
- Field of View (FOV) decreases (narrower view)
- Targets appear larger
- Better for identification and precision

**Display**:
- "ZOOM: xx.x" indicator increases
- "FOV: xx.x°" indicator decreases

**Maximum Zoom**:
- Day camera: 20x optical zoom (FOV narrows to ~3°)
- Thermal camera: 2x digital zoom (FOV narrows to ~12°)

---

#### **Zoom Out (Button 8)**

**Operation**:
1. Press and HOLD Button 8
2. Image zooms out (widens) continuously
3. Release when desired zoom level reached

**Effect**:
- Field of View (FOV) increases (wider view)
- More situational awareness
- Better for search and tracking

**Display**:
- "ZOOM: xx.x" indicator decreases
- "FOV: xx.x°" indicator increases

**Minimum Zoom**:
- Day camera: 1x (FOV widens to ~60°)
- Thermal camera: 1x (FOV widens to ~24°)

---

#### **Zoom Usage Tips**

**General Guidelines**:
- **Zoom Out** for search and situational awareness
- **Zoom In** for target identification and engagement
- **Intermediate Zoom** for tracking (balance between FOV and detail)

**Lead Angle Compensation Considerations**:
- LAC requires sufficient FOV to calculate target velocity
- If zoomed in too far, LAC may display "ZOOM OUT" warning
- Recommend max zoom of 10x when using LAC on moving targets

**Tracking Considerations**:
- Wide FOV (zoomed out) makes tracking acquisition easier (larger search area)
- Narrow FOV (zoomed in) provides better tracking accuracy but increases risk of losing target

---

### **3.5.3 Thermal Camera Palette Selection (LUT)**

**Function**: Changes thermal image color scheme for different viewing preferences and target contrast

**LUT** = Look-Up Table (color palette)

**Available Palettes**: 13 palettes (numbered 0-12)

**Common Palettes**:
- **White Hot**: Hot objects appear white, cold objects black (high contrast)
- **Black Hot**: Hot objects appear black, cold objects white (reverse contrast)
- **Rainbow**: Color gradient from blue (cold) to red (hot)
- **Iron**: Red/yellow/white scale (popular for target detection)
- **Lava**: Red/orange/yellow scale (high visibility)
- **Sepia**: Brown tones (easy on eyes)
- **And others...**

---

#### **LUT Controls**

**Next LUT (Button 7)**:

**Operation**:
1. Press Button 7
2. Palette advances to next LUT (e.g., LUT 0 → LUT 1)
3. Repeat to cycle through all palettes

**Cycling**: LUT 12 → wraps to LUT 0

---

**Previous LUT (Button 9)**:

**Operation**:
1. Press Button 9
2. Palette goes to previous LUT (e.g., LUT 1 → LUT 0)
3. Repeat to cycle backward through palettes

**Cycling**: LUT 0 → wraps to LUT 12

---

#### **When to Use LUT Selection**

**Situation-Dependent**:
- **High contrast targets** (vehicle vs. sky): White Hot or Black Hot
- **Target detection in clutter**: Iron or Lava (colors help distinguish heat sources)
- **Prolonged viewing**: Sepia or Rainbow (less eye strain)
- **Personal preference**: Experiment to find what works best

**Active Only on Thermal Camera**:
- LUT buttons have NO effect when day camera is selected
- When you switch to thermal camera, last-used LUT is active

**Best Practice**: Set preferred LUT during setup/training, memorize palette order for quick switching.

---

### **3.5.4 Camera Focus**

**Day Camera**:
- **Auto-focus**: Enabled by default (focus adjusts automatically)
- **Manual focus**: Not available in standard configuration
- Generally requires no operator input

**Thermal Camera**:
- **Fixed focus**: Thermal cameras typically have fixed focus (no adjustment needed)
- Focus-free operation

**If image is blurry**:
- Day camera: May be auto-focus issue - zoom in/out to trigger refocus
- Thermal camera: May be dirty lens - clean lens per maintenance procedures
- Either camera: May be fog/condensation on lens - wipe lens
