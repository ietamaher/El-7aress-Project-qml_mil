---

## 1.2 SAFETY RULES AND REGULATIONS

### **RULE 1: TREAT EVERY WEAPON AS LOADED**

The RCWS controls a live weapon. Always assume the weapon is:
- Loaded with live ammunition
- Ready to fire
- Capable of causing death or serious injury

**NEVER**:
- Point the weapon at anything you do not intend to destroy
- Discharge the weapon outside authorized zones
- Override safety interlocks

### **RULE 2: KNOW YOUR TARGET AND WHAT IS BEYOND IT**

Before engaging:
- Positively identify the target
- Verify no-fire zones are not violated
- Ensure no friendly forces are in the line of fire
- Consider projectile trajectory and maximum range

### **RULE 3: KEEP YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER UNTIL READY TO FIRE**

Weapons engagement requires:
1. Station Enable active
2. Master Arm engaged (Button 0 on joystick)
3. Target confirmed
4. Fire authorization received
5. Fire button pressed (Button 5 on joystick)

**DO NOT** engage Master Arm or fire unless actively engaging a target.

### **RULE 4: USE THE SAFETY**

The RCWS has multiple safety features:
- **Emergency Stop Button** (Control Panel): Immediately halts all system motion
- **Dead Man Switch** (Joystick Button 3): Must be held for critical operations
- **Master Arm** (Joystick Button 0): Gates weapons fire
- **Station Enable Switch** (Control Panel): Master power control
- **No-Fire Zones**: Software prevents firing in prohibited areas
- **No-Traverse Zones**: Software prevents gimbal motion into restricted areas

**ALL SAFETY FEATURES MUST BE FUNCTIONAL BEFORE OPERATION**

---

## 1.3 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES OVERVIEW

### **EMERGENCY STOP**

**When to Use**:
- Immediate danger to personnel
- Equipment malfunction
- Uncontrolled system movement
- Any unsafe condition

**How to Execute**:
1. Press **EMERGENCY STOP** button on Control Panel
2. All motion stops immediately
3. Weapon safe is automatic
4. System enters safe state

**Recovery**:
- Emergency stop must be reset by qualified personnel
- System diagnostic check required before resuming operations

### **CEASE FIRE**

**When to Use**:
- Range safety officer command
- Target misidentification
- Friendly forces in danger area
- Equipment malfunction

**How to Execute**:
1. Release fire button (Button 5) immediately
2. Release Master Arm (Button 0)
3. Announce "CEASE FIRE"
4. Keep weapon pointed in safe direction

---

## 1.4 SAFETY ZONES

### **No-Fire Zones**

**Definition**: Geographic areas where weapon discharge is absolutely prohibited.

**Examples**:
- Friendly troop positions
- Civilian structures
- Protected infrastructure
- Safe havens

**System Behavior**:
- Warning displayed when aiming into no-fire zone
- Fire command may be blocked (depending on configuration)
- Audible and visual warnings

**Operator Responsibility**:
- Always verify target is not in a no-fire zone
- Update no-fire zones before each mission
- Report any zone violations immediately

### **No-Traverse Zones**

**Definition**: Areas the gimbal is prevented from entering due to physical obstructions or safety concerns.

**Examples**:
- Vehicle/ship superstructure
- Antenna arrays
- Personnel areas
- Equipment that could be damaged by weapon traverse

**System Behavior**:
- Gimbal movement automatically stops at zone boundary
- Cannot manually slew into restricted area
- Warning displayed on screen

**Operator Responsibility**:
- Understand platform-specific no-traverse zones
- Do not attempt to override restrictions
- Report unexpected gimbal stops

---

## 1.5 RANGE SAFETY PROTOCOLS

### **Live Fire Range Rules**

1. **Range Safety Officer (RSO) has absolute authority**
   - All commands must be obeyed immediately
   - CEASE FIRE = stop firing instantly

2. **Range is HOT when firing**
   - No personnel forward of firing line
   - All personnel wear eye and ear protection
   - Weapon pointed downrange at all times

3. **Range is COLD for target checks**
   - Weapons safe
   - Master Arm off
   - Station Enable off
   - Personnel may move downrange ONLY when authorized

4. **Emergency Signals**
   - Whistle (one long blast) = CEASE FIRE
   - Whistle (three short blasts) = Emergency
   - Red flag = Range is HOT
   - Green flag = Range is COLD
